## Blind SQL Exploitation

**To make the explanation more simple, I'm going to assume that we already know the user name, which is __admin__.**

If we try to brute force the first character, we have 256 possibilities.

But, if we use **AND**(**&** for bits) operation we can check one bit at a time and guess the letter in about 8 attempts.
Character **a** is **97** in __ASCII__, **97** is **01100001** in __binary__, and will match the masks 00000001, 00100000, and 01000000 (that correspond to the numbers 1, 32, and 64) 

So, the script is going to sum the numbers that match with our masks until we have the final number, __01100001__ in binary, __97__ in ASCII and the letter **a**.
